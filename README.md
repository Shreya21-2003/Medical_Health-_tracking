# Medical_Health_tracking
Healthcare awareness and self-care have become crucial in today's fast-paced world, where not everyone can immediately visit a doctor for minor health issues. Many people seek quick home remedies before seeking professional medical advice. This led to the idea of creating a Health Remedies & Medical Advice System, an interactive web-based application that provides reliable home remedies for common diseases and guidance on when to consult a doctor.
The goal of this system is to help users take initial care of their health issues, while also making them aware of the signs that indicate the need for professional help â€” creating a balance between self-care and expert care.
# Objective of the System

The primary objectives of this project were:

To develop an easy-to-use platform where users can access trusted home remedies for various  diseases.

To educate users on the symptoms and situations where doctor consultation becomes necessary.

To provide instant responses using a user-friendly interface, avoiding the need to search across multiple unreliable sources.
# Tools and Technologies Used

To develop this system, we used a combination of Python programming for backend logic, Gradio for user interface, and NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques to process and manage disease-related data efficiently. Below is an overview of tools used:

Python: For implementing core logic and data handling.

Gradio: To create a web-based user-friendly interface.

Natural Language Processing (NLP): For managing textual disease descriptions and ensuring user queries are mapped to correct remedies.
